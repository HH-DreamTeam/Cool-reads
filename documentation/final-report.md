# Final Report
## Eetu Alanen
- I had some problems in code not working and getting a few conflicts in github. Also some problems in managing the work. The code bugs were quite fast fixes and the conflicts too, for the problem managing the work we didn't get a good solution. I think as a team we succeeded in communicating what exercises were done! There was room to improve on the managing the work load to be even for everyone. I feel that I got alot out of this course! Just the fact that it felt like working in a real life working team! Also learned alot about git and github! I feel that everything was relevant on the course and I don't know what to add.

1.	What challenges did you face during each Sprint? Describe both technical and project management related challenges?

Technical: Some of the challenges I faced were version conflicts, and errors while executing and how to debug them. 
Project management: Uneven work distribution. Lack of full cooperation on the tasks by all team members. 

2.	Were you able to overcome these challenges? If so, how?

Was able to overcome the technical challenges but the project management challenges were not resolved.

3.	In which areas did you succeed as a team?

One of our key areas of success was finishing the tasks for each sprint on time. There were also effective communication and project updates between the team members.

4.	In which areas there was room for improvement?

The area where there was room for improvement was team collaboration in tasks assigned

5.	What did you learn during the course? What would you have wanted to learn more about? What felt irrelevant?

In general, this course has enhanced my understanding of both technical aspects and project management. It has deepened my knowledge of backend and frontend development. Everything was relevant, from understanding the needs and requirements of project owners to working in an agile manner through sprints to effectively produce a functional project. Moreover, applying version control and executing commands in the git terminal was pivotal. I also believe my skills in team collaboration have improved. I would like to learn more about testing, as well as authorization and authentication mechanisms.
